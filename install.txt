1. 	Requirements
1.1	Client side:	Any paltform will do, software is written in PHP 4.3 and is 
			therefore accessible with any webbrowser. The software has been
			tested with Konqueror, Mozilla and Firefox, IE will follow soon.
			Design was made for 1024x768 screen size.
1.2	Server side:	Running Apache webserver with PHP support,
			MySql database needed, support for other databases will follow.
			For IIS installation please read section IIS below.
			(The development has been done under SUSE Linux 9.2 Professional
			with kernel linux 2.6.8-24.5-default i686 using Quanta software 
			and was tested with Apache/2.0.50 (Linux/SUSE), PHP/4.3.8 and
			mysql version 4.0.21.)

2.	Installation
2.1	Download	If not yet done, got the latest release at 
			http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128456
2.2	Install		a) Unzip/Untar the hragency-0.x.tar.gz archive to to root folder of 
			   your webserver.
			b) Create an mysql database with any name and user rights.
			c) With any sql tool (we recommend phpMyAdmin: execute the script 
			   hragency-install.sql in /hragency/scripts/ to install tables 
			   without demo data or execute the script hragency-install-withdemodata.sql 
			   in /hragency/scripts/ to install tables with demo data.   
			d) Modify the dbconnect.php file in /hragency/include/ to fit to your 
			   configuration
			e) Modify the config.php file in /hragency/admin/ to fit language
			   base settings (fr = french, de = german, en = english)

3.	IIS		For installing on a IIS web server, please modify the global
			variables $DOCUMENT_ROOT and $_SESSION with the necessary
			variables on IIS to retreive document path of your web server 
			($DOCUMENT_ROOT) and to pass the language identifier to the web-
			browser ($_SESSION). The software should then work correctly.
			Please be aware, that the software was not tested in any manner on
			IIS and that the original developers are not familier with this 
			environnement.
